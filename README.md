# Video-Language-Translator
This Video Language Translator was a part of my SIH project which was able to translate from English to Indian Vernacular Languages like Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati or Tamil using the audio in the particular video.
This project was entirely based on Python which included libraries named Deep_Multilingual_Punctuation, Librosa,Pydub,Speech_Recognition etc.
